def guess_the_number():
    """
    The function `guess_the_number` is a guessing game where the user tries to guess a random number between 1 and 20. 

    Parameters:
    None

    Returns:
    None

    The function initializes a variable `number` with a random integer between 1 and 20, and another variable `attempts` with value 0. Then, it enters a while loop that continues until `attempts` is less than 6. In each iteration of the loop, the user is asked to input a number between 1 and 20. If the user's guess is lower than the random number, the function prints "Too low!". If the guess is higher, the function prints "Too high!". If the guess is the correct number, the function prints "Congratulations! You guessed the number!" and returns. After each guess, the `attempts` variable is incremented by 1. If the user runs out of attempts, the function prints "Sorry, you ran out of attempts. The number was" followed by the correct number.

    This function does not take any arguments and does not return any values.
